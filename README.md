Project Idea: Chuckle-Hub
Description:
Chuckle-Hub is a web application where users can find, create, and share jokes. Users can explore a wide variety of jokes, categorized by genres like puns, dad jokes, knock-knock jokes, and more. They can also contribute their own jokes to the platform.
Key Features:
* 		User Authentication:
    * Users can sign up, log in, and manage their joke profiles.
    * Only authenticated users can submit new jokes, and they can edit or delete their own jokes.
* 		Joke Discovery:
    * Integrate with a jokes API (such as JokeAPI) to fetch a random assortment of jokes for users to enjoy.
    * Implement search and filtering options for users to find jokes based on categories, keywords, or user ratings.
* 		Joke Creation and Management:
    * Users can submit their own jokes, providing a title, category, and the joke itself.
    * Implement CRUD operations for jokes, allowing users to edit or delete their own jokes.
* 		Integration of External APIs:
    * Besides the jokes API, integrate another API that adds a humorous element, such as a GIF or meme API to accompany jokes with funny images.
* 		Proper Back-end Models and Database Design:
    * Design a Django back-end with models for User, Joke, and any additional entities needed.
    * Implement proper relationships between models to store and retrieve jokes efficiently.
* 		Styling and Navigation:
    * Use React for the front-end with a light-hearted and entertaining design.
    * Implement a user-friendly interface for navigating between joke categories, submitting new jokes, and viewing top-rated jokes.
* 		Feature-Rich Application:
    * Include features like upvoting/downvoting jokes, commenting on jokes, and sharing jokes on social media.
    * Implement a joke of the day feature that highlights a particularly funny or popular joke each day.
* 		Presentation:
    * Prepare a presentation that not only demonstrates the technical aspects of the project but also highlights the humor and entertainment value.
    * Showcase the integration of third-party APIs, CRUD operations, and user authentication in a light-hearted and engaging manner.
